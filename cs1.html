          <h1 id="blogtitle">CS 1: Intro to Program Design</h1>
          <div id="blogcontent"><p><img src="cs1fair.png" style="width:100%"/><br/>  CS 1 is a class about <strong>computation</strong>, which is another way of saying that it is a class about <strong>thinking</strong>. Although you will create dozens of interactive programs in the coming year (scientific simulations, video games, text editors, digital art programs, artificial intelligences, image filters a la Instagram, website generators, and more!), coding is really just our method of choice for exploring the ideas that have animated computer science for over a century—even before there were computers!</p><p>  The question we will return to again and again is this: what is the nature of thinking? Just as someone wishing to understand the nature of flight might build an airplane rather than study a bird, we’ll use programmable thinking machines—computers—to guide our inquiry, instead of studying the brain.</p><p>  Of course, “What is the nature of thinking?” is quite broad, so we must focus. In this introductory course, we will investigate more specific questions, including:</p><ul><li><p>How do we organize <em>information</em> in the world as <em>data</em> that we can process and transform?</p></li><li><p>How can we <em>write down</em> our thinking processes, so that they can be reliably replicated by others? Does it make sense to talk about <em>elegance</em> in this representation, smart stylistic choices that reveal common patterns in thought and larger truths about computation?</p></li><li><p>Can we create an <em>aesthetic</em>, outlining what it means to express thinking <em>beautifully</em>?</p></li><li><p>In what ways do our thinking processes <em>generalize</em>? That is: how do we go from concrete solutions for small problems to abstract solutions for entire classes of problems?</p></li><li><p>How do choices about process and representation affect the <em>efficiency</em> of our thinking?</p></li><li><p>How can we look at an informal description of a problem or solution and identify the precise computational processes underlying it?</p></li></ul><p>No prior experience necessary.</p><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Course organization</h3><p>Our study of computer science comprises six units and two independent projects. Project 1 is completed in December before winter break (between units 2 and 3), and Project 2 in April (between units 4 and 5). The units are:</p></div><ul><li><p><strong>Unit 0.</strong> How computers work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 1.</strong> A language for computation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 2.</strong> Information, data, and program design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 3.</strong> Expressing the infinite: the power of recursion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 4.</strong> When operations are data: higher-order functions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unit 5.</strong> Beyond Racket: mutability, objects, and imperative programming.</p></li></ul><p>  </p><div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Selected assignments</h3><ul><li><p><a href="assignments/cs1/animations1.html">Images and animation</a></p></li><li><p><a href="assignments/cs1/ifcond1.html">Booleans and conditionals</a></p></li><li><p><a href="assignments/exploring-color-lists.html">Exploring lists of colors</a></p></li><li><p><a href="assignments/data-analysis-toolkit.html">A data analysis toolkit</a></p></li><li><p><a href="assignments/saving-progress.html">Saving progress</a></p></li><li><p><a href="assignments/madlibs.html">Mad libs</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>
