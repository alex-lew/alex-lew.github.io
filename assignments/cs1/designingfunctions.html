          <h1 id="blogtitle">Designing functions</h1>
          <div id="blogcontent"><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Assignment overview</h3><p>In this assignment, you’ll get some practice writing functions–in other words, teaching the computer new operations. Remember the process for writing a new function:</p></div><ol><li><p>Decide on a descriptive name for your function.</p></li><li><p>Write a “contract” for your function, which describes the types of its arguments and the type of its output:</p><div class="highlight"><table class="sourcetable"><tbody><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="source"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">; funcname : ArgumentType1 ArgumentType2 ... ArgumentTypeN -&gt; ResultType</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The types currently available to you are <code>Number</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>Boolean</code>.</p></li><li><p>Write a “purpose statement” for your function, which is the simplest possible answer to “what does this function compute?”</p></li><li><p>Write examples, if you’d like:</p><div class="highlight"><table class="sourcetable"><tbody><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="source"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">; area-of-square : Number -&gt; Number</span>
<span class="c1">; Computes the area of a square with given side length</span>
<span class="c1">; (area-of-square 5) should give 25</span>
<span class="c1">; (area-of-square 7) should give 49</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></li><li><p>Based on your concrete examples, choose descriptive names for your argument variables, and extract a function definition:</p><div class="highlight"><table class="sourcetable"><tbody><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="source"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">area-of-square</span> <span class="n">side-length</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">*</span> <span class="n">side-length</span> <span class="n">side-length</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ol><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Functions</h3><p>Please design the following functions, in a file called <code>YourNameDesigningFunctions.rkt</code>. At the end of this document, I’ve provided a list of potentially useful built-in functions.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">1</span><span class="problem-name">Area of an image</span></h4><p>Design a function that takes in a single argument, an image, and computes its area in pixels.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">2</span><span class="problem-name">Distance from origin</span></h4><p>Design a function that takes in two arguments, x and y coordinates of a point, and calculates the distance between (0, 0) and (x, y). (This is a Geometry question: use the distance formula!)</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">3</span><span class="problem-name">Framing an image</span></h4><p>Design a function that takes in one argument, an image, and returns that image “in a frame”–that is, placed in the center of an empty scene that is twice as big as the original image (in both dimensions).</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">4</span><span class="problem-name">Birthday greeting</span></h4><p>Design a function that takes in a person’s name, a string, and returns a birthday greeting for that person (e.g. “Happy birthday, Voldemort!“).</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="extra-challenge keep-with-next">Extra Challenge: Country flags</h4><p>Design a function that takes in a height, and produces an image of that height depicting the flag of South Korea, using only functions in the 2htdp/image.rkt teachpack. (That is, do not just copy and paste the flag into your program; create it using circles, rectangles, and rotations.) The flag looks like this:</p></div><p><img src="http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/zzzflags/krlarge.gif"/></p><p>  Its width is 1.5 times its height.</p><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="extra-challenge keep-with-next">Extra Challenge: Throwing a ball</h4><p>(Requires some physics.) Design a function that takes in two numbers: the first is the number of seconds elapsed since a ball was thrown, and the second is a “gravity” constant (in pixels per seconds squared).</p></div><p>Your function should produce an image of a ball that has been flying through the air–in a parabolic shape, as balls do–for that number of seconds, in a world with that amount of gravity. Assume the ball is thrown at time 0 with velocity 5 pixels per second at an angle of 45 degrees. Its starting position is the bottom left of a 500 by 500 empty scene.</p><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="extra-challenge keep-with-next">Extra Challenge: Clock</h4><p>(May require some trigonometry.) Design a function that takes in an hour of the day, between 0 and 11, and minutes, between 0 and 59, and produces an image of a “clock” with an hour hand pointing in the correct direction for that hour and a minute hand pointing in the correct direction for that minute. For an extra extra challenge, make it so the hour hand’s location depends also on the minutes.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Useful built-in functions</h3><p>You may find the following functions useful in completing this assignment:</p></div><ul><li><p><code>image-width : Image -&gt; Number</code><br/>Computes the width of an image, in pixels.</p></li><li><p><code>image-height : Image -&gt; Number</code><br/>Computes the height of an image, in pixels.</p></li><li><p><code>sqrt : Number -&gt; Number</code><br/>Computes the square root of a number.</p></li><li><p><code>sqr : Number -&gt; Number</code><br/>Squares a number (multiplies it by itself).</p></li><li><p><code>empty-scene : Number Number -&gt; Image</code><br/>Creates an empty rectangular scene of the given width and height, in which to place other images.</p></li><li><p><code>place-image : Image Number Number Image -&gt; Image</code><br/>Places the first image on top of the second image to obtain a new image. The image is placed so that its center appears x pixels over and y pixels down from the top left corner of the screen, where x and y are the two numerical arguments.</p></li><li><p><code>overlay : Image Image -&gt; Image</code><br/>Places the first image on top of the second image, so that the centers of each image are aligned. (That is, the first image is placed in exactly the center of the second.)</p></li><li><p><code>string-append : String String -&gt; String</code><br/>Adds two strings together into one string, by concatenating (“gluing together”) the two arguments.</p></li></ul></div>
