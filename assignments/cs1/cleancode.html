          <h1 id="blogtitle">Cleaner code</h1>
          <div id="blogcontent"><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Assignment overview</h3><p>In this assignment, you will practice writing functions that are so clear they sound like English. There are two pieces to your homework:</p></div><ol><li><p>You will implement a couple more complex functions, writing helper functions along the way.</p></li><li><p>You will revise a messy piece of code I have written that causes a picture of Justin Bieber to rotate across the screen endlessly.</p></li></ol><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Writing clean code</h3><p>Please design the following functions, in a file called <code>YourNameCleanFunctions.rkt</code>. For each one, make sure to choose names and design helper functions so the function is easy to understand.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">1</span><span class="problem-name">Love letter</span></h4><p>Design a function that generates a love letter. You can choose what pieces of information (arguments) you’d like to accept: recipient’s name, gender pronouns, best attributes, worst attributes... the possibilities are endless. The output should be a string. (It’s OK if the letter is all on one line. We haven’t yet learned how to make strings with multiple lines in them.)</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">2</span><span class="problem-name">Movie poster</span></h4><p>Design a function that creates a movie poster. You can choose what pieces of information (arguments) you’d like to accept: movie title, names of stars, theme color, main poster image, tagline... the possibilities are endless. Return an image of the poster.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">3</span><span class="problem-name">Falling things</span></h4><p>Design a function for an animation (that is, a <code>Number -&gt; Image</code> function) in which at least five things (circles, squares, etc.) fall down the screen, at different speeds and starting from different heights. (Note: if I were to ask you to add a sixth or seventh object, you shouldn’t need to add new helper functions.)</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="extra-challenge keep-with-next">Extra Challenge: Clean up an old submission</h4><p>Select an extra-challenge problem from one of the previous two homeworks (<em>Designing functions</em> or <em>Images and animation</em>) and use your newfound clean-code skills to write a clean version of it. You may find that previously difficult problems become much easier when you are able to “work backward” and keep a wishlist of helper functions.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Refactoring messy code</h3><p>In the tech community, cleaning up messy code by reorganizing it is called “refactoring.”</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">4</span><span class="problem-name">Messy Bieber</span></h4><p>Download the attached <code>MessyCode.rkt</code> file, and open it. You may want to run <code>(animate messy-animation)</code> and turn on some of your favorite Justin Bieber music while you watch. Your goal is to clean up this messy code as best you can. You can define individual values that are used a lot. You can define helper functions. The goal is to make the code as readable as possible. Upload your revised version with the file name <code>YourNameRefactoredBieber.rkt</code>. (Use the “Save Definitions As...” menu item, under the File menu, to save a copy of your code with a new filename.)</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Useful built-in functions</h3><p>You may find the following functions useful in completing this assignment:</p></div><ul><li><p><code>empty-scene : Number Number -&gt; Image</code><br/>Creates an empty rectangular scene of the given width and height, in which to place other images.</p></li><li><p><code>place-image : Image Number Number Image -&gt; Image</code><br/>Places the first image on top of the second image to obtain a new image. The image is placed so that its center appears x pixels over and y pixels down from the top left corner of the screen, where x and y are the two numerical arguments.</p></li><li><p><code>overlay : Image Image -&gt; Image</code><br/>Places the first image on top of the second image, so that the centers of each image are aligned. (That is, the first image is placed in exactly the center of the second.)</p></li><li><p><code>text : String Number String -&gt; Image</code><br/>Creates an image out of a string. The first string argument determines what text to display; the number and the second string argument determine the font size and color, respectively.</p></li></ul></div>
