          <h1 id="blogtitle">Machine learning (mini-project)</h1>
          <div id="blogcontent"><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Assignment overview</h3><p>Now that you’ve learned the basics of Go’s type system and control structures, you’re ready for a bigger project. Alone or with a partner, you will spend the next two weeks investigating a classic machine learning algorithm and implementing it in Go. Then, using your code, you’ll analyze a dataset of your choosing and present it to the class. Have fun!</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">The problem: Classification</h3><p>“Machine learning” is a broad term. For the purposes of this project, we will be considering problems of the following sort:</p></div><p><strong>Given a set of data points, each labeled as belonging to some category, learn to predict which category a new, unobserved data point belongs to.</strong></p><p>Many problems can be phrased this way:</p><ol><li><p>Given a large number of example spam emails and normal emails, learn to predict whether a new email is spam or real.</p></li><li><p>Given a large number of pictures of handwritten digits (0-9), learn to categorize new pictures of handwritten digits as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.</p></li><li><p>Given a large number of positive and negative reviews, learn to classify a new review as positive or negative.</p></li><li><p>Given data for a large number of patients who have or don’t have a certain disease, learn to predict whether a new patient has the disease based on their patient data.</p></li><li><p>Given a large number of documents written by different authors, learn to tell which author wrote a new, unlabeled document.</p></li></ol><p>You can probably think of more!</p><p>If you’re trying to tackle this kind of problem, you can imagine taking two different approaches. One is that a human could look through the examples, and try to figure out specific rules that you could then code up. For example, you (a human) might notice that a lot of spam emails happen to have lots of exclamation points, and write code to classify any message containing more than 6 exclamation points as spam. But generally, these problems are complex enough that this rule-based approach doesn’t work too well. Instead, we use <em>machine learning</em> algorithms, which figure out the rules on their own by examining the collected data.</p><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Expectations</h3><p>This project will require more independent work than a typical assignment in this course. You are responsible for doing the following things:</p></div><ol><li><p>Finding a dataset you’d like to examine. I have some suggestions at the bottom of this document, and am also happy to help you search. It should be a not-too-complex dataset that lends itself to classification problems.</p></li><li><p>Dividing the dataset into “training” and “test” data. There are multiple ways to do this.</p></li><li><p>Using Go, create a data structure that will hold your dataset in memory. This might be a slice, a map, a struct, or a combination (a slice of structs containing maps, for instance). Write a function to read the data from a file into your data structure. You may want to Google around for useful Go libraries–people have already solved the problem of reading CSV files!</p></li><li><p>Research and implement a machine learning algorithm to analyze the dataset and solve the classification problem that you have selected.</p></li><li><p>Test your algorithm by running it on the test set and computing your accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Create a presentation outlining your process: the decisions you made, how your algorithm works, and the results you got. Did you gain any insight into the nature of your data?</p></li></ol><p>You must turn in <em>well-commented Go code</em> for all of this, as well as a description of how your program works / what each Go file is responsible for.</p><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Algorithms</h3><p>It is up to you which algorithm you research and implement. I describe three possible choices below, but if you are excited about a fourth option you’ve heard of, just discuss it with me. (Note: many modern machine learning methods require a more extensive background in statistics and/or calculus! The three below should be accessible to everyone.)</p></div><p>Your goal will be to understand and implement the algorithm you choose. In doing so, you will need to choose data structures and design abstractions to support your algorithm. Remember all the tools you have at your disposal: interfaces, structs, pointers, maps, slices, arrays. I am happy to discuss your design choices with you.</p><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">1</span><span class="problem-name"><code>k</code> Nearest Neighbors</span></h4><p>This algorithm is comparatively simple. In order to use it, it is necessary first to formulate some version of “distance” between data points, that is, some way of measuring how similar any two data points are. This is easy if your data points are numbers, but harder if you are dealing with documents or images. You will have to research or experiment with good ways of measuring distance.</p></div><p>Once you have this distance measure, the algorithm works as follows. Given a new piece of data, find the <code>k</code> <em>already-known</em> pieces of data that are nearest to it. Each of them get a “vote” for which category the new piece of data should belong to. Whatever category wins, that is the output of your algorithm. <code>k</code> is a number you choose: when <code>k = 1</code>, you are simply saying that the new data point’s label is the same as the label of its nearest known neighbor. A larger <code>k</code> makes your decisions a bit less arbitrary. Your code should support any value of <code>k</code>, and you should experiment with different values and see what gives the best results.</p><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">2</span><span class="problem-name">Naïve Bayes Classifier</span></h4><p>In a Naïve Bayes Classifier, we use Bayes’ rule to determine the probability of a certain label given the input data. We come up with a “naïve story” of how the data are generated, and then given a new piece of data, use the story to estimate the probability that it belongs to each category.</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">3</span><span class="problem-name">Decision Trees</span></h4><p>A decision tree is a flow chart of yes/no functions, ending in “it’s spam!” or “it’s not spam!” (in a spam classification example). We can use the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree from our dataset. This article from Princeton does a good job of explaining: <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr07/cos424/papers/mitchell-dectrees.pdf">www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr07/cos424/papers/mitchell-dectrees.pdf</a></p></div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Dataset suggestions</h3><p>I will be updating this section soon. Some classic datasets are listed here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_research">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_research</a>.</p></div></div>
