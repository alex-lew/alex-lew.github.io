          <h1 id="blogtitle">Shapes with structs</h1>
          <div id="blogcontent"><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Assignment overview</h3><p>In this assignment, you will create a simple “drawing” library for the Terminal. In the process, you will practice creating structure types and writing methods for them!</p></div><div class="nobreak"><h3 class="assignment-heading keep-with-next">Problems</h3><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">1</span><span class="problem-name">A type for positions</span></h4><p>Create a structure type for storing an (x, y) cooridnate pair, using float64s. Give it the following methods:</p></div></div><ul><li><p><code>(p posn) moveBy(other posn)</code>, which returns a position moved a certain amount in x and y directions, as determined by the argument (also a position).</p></li><li><p><code>(p posn) distanceFrom(other posn)</code>, which uses the distance formula to return a float64 representing how far <code>p</code> is from the argument position.</p></li><li><p><code>(p posn) multiplyBy(amount float64)</code>, which multiplies each coordinate by the given amount.</p></li><li><p><code>(p posn) stepToward(other posn, amount float64)</code>, which returns a position moved toward another position by a certain amount. Hint: Use <code>other.x - p.x, other.y - p.y</code> to get the amount you’d have to travel from p to other in one step. You can then divide this by the distance between <code>p</code> and <code>other</code>, and multiply by <code>amount</code>, to get the amount you have to move in each direction. This can then be passed to <code>moveBy</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>(p posn) roundedX()</code>, which returns the x coordinate, rounded to the nearest integer.</p></li><li><p><code>(p posn) roundedY()</code>, which returns the y coordinate, rounded to the nearest integer.</p></li></ul><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">2</span><span class="problem-name">Rectangle</span></h4><p>Create a <code>rectangle</code> type, which stores a position at which it starts, a width, and a height.</p></div><p>It should have <code>moveBy</code> and <code>stepToward</code> methods that return new rectangles with the appropriate methods called on the rectangle’s position. It should also have a <code>draw</code> method, which takes no arguments and draws this rectangle on the screen, using <code>|</code> and <code>–</code> characters. If the rectangle’s (rounded) position is (5, 7), there should be 5 columns of spaces and 7 rows of spaces before the rectangle begins. Furthermore, so that this will work well with your next problem, please draw at least 24 rows–if the rectangle ends before the 24th row, just add empty rows after you’ve drawn the rectangle.</p><div class="nobreak"><h4 class="assignment-problem keep-with-next"><span class="problem-number">3</span><span class="problem-name">Flipbook animation</span></h4><p>Design an “animation” of sorts, by doing the following:</p></div><ol><li><p>Write a function <code>rectangleForFrame(frame int)</code>, which takes in a “frame number” of the animation, and returns a rectangle that should be drawn at that frame. You can choose to make whatever animation you want–perhaps the rectangle moves toward a point, or maybe it grows and then shrinks, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Write a function <code>animate(anim func (int) rectangle, numFrames int)</code>, which takes in an animation function (like the one you wrote above), and animates it for numFrames frames. To do this, call the rectangle’s <code>draw</code> method on successively higher frame numbers, starting at 0 and going to numFrames. Between each frame, use <code>fmt.Scanln()</code>, which will wait for the user to press Enter.</p></li><li><p>Call your function from <code>main</code>.</p></li></ol></div>
